#### Description:

    In the beggining,I want to explain that this app was made with tkinter library.The purpose of choosing that library is the facilities of that library.And I used PIL in order to provide the chance of editting images.And I also used the function of messagebox in order to give some error messages when something goes wrong.Moreover,I used qrcode library to produce some qr codes,random to give me accees to mix rock,paper and rock.Lastly,I used os on the purpose of managing the files.

    If we talk about the general structure of the code,I declared some functions which are create,delete,download,open qr page,open guess page,open calculator page,qr page,guess page,calculator page,calculate,clear_entry and main page.The functions that create,delete,download,open qr page are related to qr code maker.Secondly,The functions that open guess page,guess page are related to guess page and the rest of these functionalites are related to calculator.These functions are the fundemantel of this app.I am going to explain those functions.

    At the begginging of the app,I declared some libraries that qrcode,os,tkinter,PIL and random.Then in the definition of create function,I declared a url variable which is global in order to be in out of scope than with get function I took some database from user.I checked that if computer can not find a url it will return a error.Also in the case of not starting with http:/
    / it will reurn a error.Then I declared a "img" that takes qrcode that display the QR code on the label.Delete function deletes the entry by delete function from tkinter.And in the download section,I aimed to give an opprtunity to download qr codes in their computers. I checked that if there is an url and declared the desktop_path.Also,I made a counter that counts the number of file and renames those files.Moreover,I used save function to save the file as a "Png" file and in the open qr page,this function destroys main and open qr page.In the qr page,I made an ınterface and added some labels and buttons in order to make this app more user-friendly.

    In the process of making guess game page,I made an interface.Then I checked that ıf user_choice is in the list of "Rock,Paper,Scissiors" and declared the computer
    choice by random.And I wrote some cod lines that declares the possibilities of this game and how to react when one of these possibilities happens.Rest of the guess game page,I declared some labels that drives user to play this game.Moreover,I made some buttons in order to give some features to user to play this game.Also,I made a home button that allows user to go back to homa page.

    In the calculator page,I defined some functions.Firstly,the function of calculator
    page allow the user to destroy the main page and open the calculator page when user hits the button of "Open Calculator Page".Then I declared a result label in order to state the result of some mathematicial transactions.Then I declared some number buttons on the purpose of making prettier this page by using for loops.İn these for loops,in every row and colum fills with buttons.This action provided me time saving.In the first loop,I detected each row.In the second for loop I
    detected each row and combined those and produced buttons.Moreover,in order to make buttons more prettier I created a list whose name is button_colors in order to use it in the process of making buttons.Then I declared a append to entry function that lets user display the numbers which was written when buttons are hit by getting the value variable and If there is something on the entry,this function will delete it.In the calculate function,the result is calculated and ıf there is an invalud value,ıt returns an error message.The rest of the app is made of some labels,buttons and entrys.

    In the main page of application,I prefered a basic interface in order to make this app more user-friendly.I used title to give a title to this app.Later,I gave it a background color.And I used "geometry" in order to make app's interface stabile .

    Lastly,I want to talk about design of this app.Firstly,I took advantages of the features of labels like fonts,background,foreground,borderwidth,relief,highlightthickness etc... Also I used buttons as inputs by adding them some visuality.For instance font,relief,width etc...To sum up,I benefited a lot of features from tkinter.
